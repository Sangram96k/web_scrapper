Web scraping involves extracting data from websites
web scraping should be done ethically and in compliance with the website's terms of service. Additionally, some websites may have restrictions on scraping, so it's crucial to review and adhere to their policies.
For web scraping in Python, you can use libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests. If you haven't installed these libraries yet, you can do so using:
```

pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
```
